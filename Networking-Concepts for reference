All of my review comprehension notes will be put to this repo.

Fundamental networking instructions 
1) Ipconfig or Ipconfig/all: will offer you with all of your system's information, such as biodata.

2) Nslookup: is a network administrator command-line utility for querying the Domain Name System (DNS) to acquire domain name or IP address mapping records, as well as other DNS data.

We may check with the IP address for whatever website or if you offer www.anyupdates.com as an example, we will retrieve the IP address for that.

3) PING: is a command utility used by computer network administrators to test the reachability of a host on an internet protocol IP network.

For example, you can ping the hostname or IP address of the server you want to access.

4) TRACERT: A traceroute or tracert command is a computer network diagnostic command that displays probable routes and measures packet transit times across an IP network.
We must verify that the time out will strike this command source to destination without any delays or routers.

5) NETSTAT (Network statistics): This is a command-line network utility that displays network connection statistics.
